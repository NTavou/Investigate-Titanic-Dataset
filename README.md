This repository contains the second project for Udacity's **Data Analyst Nanodegree**.  


- This project investigates some of the factors that most likely influenced the survival rate of the passengers of the RMS Titanic during its sinking. 

- NumPy, Pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib were used to answer several questions based on the data.
The report was generated in a Jupyter Notebook. 


- The Titanic dataset can by found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?test.csv) (train.csv) at the Kaggle website.
