## P2 Investigate a Dataset
This repository contains the second project for Udacity's **Data Analyst Nanodegree**.  
This project investigates some of the factors that most likely influenced the survival rate of a sample of the **Titanic passengers**. NumPy, Pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib were used to answer several questions based on the data.
This project was generated in a Jupyter Notebook. 
The Titanic dataset can by found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?test.csv) (train.csv) at the Kaggle website.
