## P2 Investigate a Dataset
This repository contains the second project for Udacity's **Data Analyst Nanodegree**.  
The project investigates some of the factors that most likely influenced the survival rate of a sample of the **Titanic passengers**. NumPy, Pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib were used to answer several questions based on the data.

More specifically, this repository contains:
- iPython notebook - used to generate the report "P2 Investigate a Dataset.ipynb"
- HTML version of the report "P2 Investigate a Dataset.html"
- copy of the dataset "titanic_data.csv"

The dataset used can by found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?test.csv) (train.csv) at the Kaggle website.
